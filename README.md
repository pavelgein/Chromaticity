## Chromaticity
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/pavelgein/Chromaticity.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/pavelgein/Chromaticity)

This repo contains some tools, helping to study chromatic polynomials of complete multipartite graphs.

Structure:
- graph_cases/bin A program, which study the chromatic uniqueness of complete multipartite graphs.
- graph_cases/invariant_exporer A program, which explore chromatic invariants, if you delete some edges from complete multipartite graph.
- graph_cases/acyclic_orientations_calculator Calculate the number of acyclic orientations of the graph.

- graph_cases/lib Some helping code
- graph_cases/tests unit tests
